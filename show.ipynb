    "## ABSTRACT\n",
    "Traditional object detection algorithms often struggle to detect small objects in remote sensing images because of their small size and complex backgrounds. To address this, We propose a high performance remote sensing image object detection model SCW-YOLO based on the YOLOv8 model. Firstly, the model incorporated an Efficient Cross Scale Feature Pyramid Network (ECFPN) to enabled richer feature fusion without increasing computational costs caused by continuous downsampling by adding a new feature layer to the shallow network and directly outputting the backbone network features to the detection head. Additionally, a coordinate attention mechanism was employed to refine the backbone network by locally enhancing the features and reducing interference from redundant information. Finally, to further improve bounding box loss fitting and accelerate network convergence, a dynamic non-monotonic Wise-IoU (WIOU) loss function was introduced to replace the loss function of baseline. The experimental results indicated that SCW-YOLO outperformed most state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in parameter efficiency and small-object detection accuracy, confirming its robustness in detecting small targets in remote sensing images."
